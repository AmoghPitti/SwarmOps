# Service Management

This document explains the implementation of service management features in SwarmOps, focusing on managing and monitoring services efficiently.

---

## Overview

The Service Management module in SwarmOps allows administrators to:  
- Monitor service status and performance.  
- Scale services to meet dynamic application demands.  
- Search for services using predefined attributes for efficient management.

---

## Backend Architecture

### Utility Functions Supporting Service Management
- **Service Processing**:
  - `node_prcs(node)` transforms raw node data from Docker Swarm into actionable formats for better service monitoring.
- **Docker Client**:
  - `docker_client()` establishes connections with the Docker API to enable scaling, updating, and monitoring services.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Retrieve Services
- **Endpoint**: `GET /services`
- **Description**:
  - Fetches a list of all services in the Swarm cluster.
- **Response**:
  - Returns an array of service objects with details such as:
    - Service name
    - Current replicas
    - Status (running or stopped)

### 2. Update Service
- **Endpoint**: `POST /services/update/<service_id>`
- **Description**:
  - Updates an existing service with new configurations.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "<service_name>",
    "replicas": "<number_of_replicas>"
  }
- **Response**:
  - Confirmation message upon successful update.

#### 3. Delete Service
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /services/delete/<id>`
- **Description**:
  - Removes a service from the Swarm cluster.
  - **Response**:
  - Confirmation message upon successful deletion.

## Integration with Frontend

The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful principles:

### Service Monitoring
- Sends `GET` requests to the backend endpoint `/services` to retrieve real-time service metrics and statuses.
- Data is processed by backend utilities (`node_prcs`) before being delivered to the frontend.

### Scaling Operations
- Sends `POST` requests to `/services/update/<service_id>` with updated replica counts to adjust service scaling as needed.
- The backend leverages Docker APIs to implement scaling changes and returns confirmation or error responses.

### Service Deletion
- Sends `DELETE` requests to `/services/delete/<id>` to remove unwanted services from the cluster.
- The backend ensures safe deletion through error handling mechanisms and provides status updates.
