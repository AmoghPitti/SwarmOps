# Task Inspection

This document explains the implementation and functionality of task inspection in SwarmOps, focusing on retrieving task-level details linked to specific services.

---

## Overview

Task Inspection in SwarmOps enables administrators to:
- Retrieve service details alongside their associated tasks.
- Monitor and debug individual tasks for performance and resource issues.

---

## Backend Architecture

### Utility Functions Supporting Task Inspection
- **Task Processing**:
  - `task_prcs(task)` processes raw task data retrieved from Docker Swarm into actionable insights.
- **Docker Client**:
  - `docker_client()` establishes a connection to the Docker environment to fetch task-related information.

---

## API Endpoints

### Retrieve Service and Task Details
- **Endpoint**: `GET /services/inspect/<id>`
- **Description**:
  - Fetches detailed information about a specific service by its ID, along with associated tasks.
- **Response**:
  - Includes:
    - **Service Data**: Processed using `svc_prcs()`.
    - **Tasks Data**: Processed using `task_prcs()` for task-level insights.

---

## Integration with Frontend

1. **Service and Task Monitoring**:
   - Sends `GET /services/inspect/<id>` requests to retrieve service details alongside associated tasks.

2. **Task Debugging**:
   - Allows administrators to analyze granular task data, such as logs, statuses, and node assignments.
